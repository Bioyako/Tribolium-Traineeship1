# [`FT-ENV.G1`](./1_GWAS/3_Plots/FT-ENV.G1) - SIGNIFICANT PVAL

`ENV.G1` [GWAS.5](../../README.md#gwas-information) and `FT.G1` [GWAS.6](../../README.md#gwas-information) folders consists of these plots:

[G1_??_emmax.jpg]
- log_pvalues distribution from Emmax model
- adjusted(FDR) log_pvalues distribution from Emmax model
- log_pvalues distribution from Emmax model against uniform distribution of theoretical quantiles of the same log_pvalues
- adjusted(FDR) log_pvalues distribution from Emmax model against uniform distribution of theoretical quantiles of the same log_pvalues

[G1_??_lm.jpg]
- log_pvalues distribution from Emmax model against log_pvalues distribution from a general Linear model
- beta coefficient of the Emmax model against beta coefficient of a general Linear model

[G1_??_MANPLOT.jpg]
- Manhattan plot of adjusted log_pvalues from Emmax model

[G1_??_MANPLOT_SoI.jpg]
- Manhattan plot of SNPs of Interest (Significant SNPs arbitrarily enriched of some categories[GENE_dataset]) with annotations

[G1_??_PARA_FC.jpg]
- distribution of adjusted(FDR) significant log_pvalues from Emmax model on Parallelism and logFoldChange categories[GENE_dataset]

## Extra

[G1_FTvsENV.jpg]
- contrast of log_pvalues, adjusted log_pvalues, and beta, between [GWAS.5](../../README.md#gwas-information) and [GWAS.6](../../README.md#gwas-information)
