# [`CT-HD.G1`](./1_GWAS/3_Plots/CT-HD.G1) - NO SIGNIFICANT PVAL

[GWAS.1](../../README.md#gwas-information) and [GWAS.2](../../README.md#gwas-information) .jpg consists of 4 plots:

- log_pvalues distribution from Emmax model
- adjusted(FDR) log_pvalues distribution from Emmax model
- log_pvalues distribution from Emmax model against uniform distribution of theoretical quantiles of the same log_pvalues
- log_pvalues distribution from Emmax model against log_pvalues distribution from a general Linear model
